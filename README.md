# TTS 3000: a highlighted-text-to-speech reader

Controls
- **CTRL + b** == play/pause highlighted text
- **ALT  + v** == rewind
- **ALT  + n** == fast-forward
- Minimise the prompt/console/terminal window to use TTS 3000
- Close the prompt/console/terminal window to quit TTS 3000

User guide
1) Download or clone this GitHub repository, and unzip it if it downloads as a .zip file
2) Run the program (main.py), such as via opening/double-clicking launch_tts.bat or via Anaconda Prompt
3) Minimise the console once you see "TTS 3000 in now running"
4) Highlight some text, such as in a browser, Word document, or PDF, and press CTRL + b (default, can be changed)
- Optional: customise playback settings and hotkeys using the USER SETTINGS section near the top of the main.py file, which can be opened in, for example, Notepad.
- Note: TTS 300 creates temporary audio files, so be aware of who has access to your TTS 3000 folder. Anyone with access to your TTS 3000 folder will be able to see the temporary TTS 3000 audio files while they exist. You should avoid, for example, placing TTS 3000 in a folder on a shared drive and then using TTS 3000 to read private bank statements.
